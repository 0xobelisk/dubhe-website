# Requirements Confirmation - Organization Update

## Original Request
Update the website to show that Dubhe is contributed by four organizations:
- **DubheOS**: Dubhe's global decentralized community contributing ecosystem toolchain
- **Obelisk Labs**: Responsible for Dubhe core component development (Engine, Channel, OS protocols)
- **Cyferio Labs**: Responsible for cryptography and Rollup components
- **Numeron OS**: Responsible for ecosystem applications (games) and technical integration

## Screenshot Analysis
The provided screenshot shows a current implementation displaying two organizations (Obelisk Labs and Cyferio Labs) with their respective roles and contributions. The layout uses a card-based design with organization names, descriptions, and contribution lists.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
1. **Display Four Organizations**: Update from current 2 organizations to 4 organizations
2. **Organization Details**:
   - DubheOS: Global decentralized community, ecosystem toolchain contribution
   - Obelisk Labs: Core protocol development (Engine, Channel, OS protocols)
   - Cyferio Labs: Privacy & zero-knowledge, cryptographic protocols
   - Numeron OS: Gaming applications and technical integration
3. **Visual Consistency**: Maintain current design language and card layout
4. **Internationalization**: Support multiple languages for new content

### Technical Requirements
1. **Component Location**: Update components in the investor/team section
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensure 4 cards display properly on all screen sizes
3. **Translation Keys**: Add new translation keys for organization descriptions
4. **Maintain Existing Features**: Keep Visit Lab links and contribution lists

### Quality Score Assessment
- **Functional Clarity (28/30)**: Clear requirements for 4 organizations with specific roles
- **Technical Specificity (23/25)**: Component locations identified, need clarification on exact implementation
- **Implementation Completeness (22/25)**: Edge cases for responsive layout need consideration
- **Business Context (18/20)**: Clear value proposition, priority understood

**Current Quality Score: 91/100**

## Clarification Questions Resolved

1. **Q: Should we maintain the current visual design with cards?**
   - A: Yes, maintain consistency with existing design

2. **Q: How should the 4 cards be arranged on different screen sizes?**
   - A: 2x2 grid on desktop, single column on mobile

3. **Q: Should we keep the "Visit Lab" links for all organizations?**
   - A: Yes, if available for each organization

## Final Confirmed Requirements
