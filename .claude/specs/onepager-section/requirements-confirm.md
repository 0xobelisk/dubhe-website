# Requirements Confirmation - OnePager Section Feature

## Original Request
Add a OnePager section to the papers page, ensuring internationalization (i18n) support is included.

## Repository Context Impact
Based on the repository scan, the following context applies:
- **Existing Papers Page**: Already implemented with whitepaper and lightpaper cards
- **Component Pattern**: Uses PaperCard component with glass morphism design
- **I18n System**: next-intl with 16 supported locales
- **Translation Structure**: JSON message files in `/apps/web/messages/`
- **PDF Handling**: Locale-specific PDFs with English fallback mechanism

## Requirements Clarification Process

### Round 1: Initial Analysis
Based on the image and repository context, I need to clarify:

1. **OnePager Content & Purpose**
   - What is the OnePager document? (Similar to lightpaper but shorter? Executive summary?)
   - Will there be a PDF file for the OnePager?
   - Should it follow the same download pattern as whitepaper/lightpaper?

2. **Visual Layout**
   - Should the OnePager appear as a third card in the existing grid?
   - Or should it have its own dedicated section?
   - Any specific icon preference for the OnePager card?

3. **Internationalization Requirements**
   - Will OnePager PDFs be available in all 16 locales?
   - Should we implement the same fallback-to-English mechanism?
   - What are the title and description translations for OnePager?

4. **Technical Integration**
   - Should we maintain the existing 2-column grid and add OnePager as a third item?
   - Or adjust to a 3-column layout on large screens?
   - Any specific order preference (whitepaper, lightpaper, onepager)?

## Proposed Requirements (Pending Clarification)

Based on the existing patterns, I propose:

### Functional Requirements
1. Add a OnePager card to the papers page
2. Implement PDF download functionality with locale-specific files
3. Support all 16 existing locales with English fallback
4. Maintain consistent user experience with existing paper cards

### Technical Requirements
1. Create OnePager translations in all message JSON files
2. Add OnePager PDF files to `/public/papers/` directory
3. Reuse existing PaperCard component
4. Adjust grid layout to accommodate third card

### Visual Requirements
1. Use FileText icon (consistent with other papers)
2. Maintain glass morphism design
3. Position after lightpaper in the grid
4. Responsive layout: stack on mobile, grid on desktop

## Questions for User

To achieve 90+ quality score, please clarify:

1. **OnePager Document Details**:
   - What is the purpose of the OnePager? (e.g., "Quick overview", "Executive summary", "Key highlights")
   - Will you provide OnePager PDF files, or should I use placeholder text for now?

2. **Layout Preference**:
   - Should I keep the 2-column layout and place OnePager below (creating a 2+1 layout)?
   - Or adjust to a 3-column layout on large screens?
   - Any specific order preference?

3. **Translation Content**:
   - What should the OnePager title be? (e.g., "OnePager", "Quick Guide", "Executive Summary")
   - What description text should appear on the card?
   - Should the download label be "Download OnePager" or something else?

4. **Implementation Priority**:
   - Should I implement with placeholder content first and you'll add PDFs later?
   - Or wait for actual OnePager content before implementation?

Please provide these clarifications so I can proceed with a complete implementation plan.
